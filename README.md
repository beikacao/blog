# About

This is my personal technical blog. All opinions expressed are solely mine.

In this blog, I'll talk about key areas in the networking world that I consider important.

  - *Network Modeling*
    - How to ensure model consistency & flexibility across teams?
    - How to model & capture network changes?
    - How to guarentee the model "reflects" the network in production?
    
  - *Network Analytics & Intelligence*
    - AI/ML is all the rage these days.
    - How applicable are these algorithms to the problems in the networking domain?
    - How can distributed learning help distributed network operations?
    
  - *Network Simulation & Verification*
    - The evolution of nework simulation/emulation technologies & trade-offs
    - The frontiers of network verification methods
    
  - *Network Closed-Loop Control*
    - Self-driving networks is the goal.
    - What does the well-studied control theory have to offer for network automation?
    - How to reconcile human interventions & algorithmic controls?
